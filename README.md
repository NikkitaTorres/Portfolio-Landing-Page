# Portfolio-Landing-Page

Written and produced by me, myself, and I, Nikkita Torres.

## Description

This is a project for creating a landing page to Nikkita Torres's portfolio. The purpose of this project is to give others, primarily future employers, an idea of who he is, what he's trying to accomplish and what he's _**already**_ accomplished.

This is only a start to the project that will hopefully be improved over time.
